Prompt: Hey there! We from the MLH CTF team would like to welcome everyone to the first official Fellowship CTF! We hope you are as excited as we are for this. </br></br> So CTF stands for Capture The Flag. It is a competition where teams try to exploit systems to get `flags`. Flags are just strings of text, frequently in a certain format. For this CTF the flags are in the format of `mlh{}`, so a valid flag will always look like `mlh{i_am_a_flag}` and never like `i_am_a_flag`. </br></br> The flag for this challenge is `mlh{i_read_the_welcome_chall}`. Go ahead and submit it in the field below to get some points! </br></br> **Note**: Also, don't worry if you've never played a CTF before. We made this one just for you. From everyone at the CTF team, we hope you have an amazing time!
