# MLH Batch 1 CTF Writeups
This is a central repository for accumulating all the write-ups relating to the CTF put on for batch 1 MLH fellows. First off, big thanks to Karan Sheth, Gabriel, Rashika, Arsalan, and Will for organizing and putting this event on. Everyone learned a lot and we genuinely enjoyed this event (most of the time). 

# How to use this repository
You will see there is a folder for each challenge in the event. 

To add your write up please: 
1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a branch with a relevant name (i.e. include your team name or challenge you are submitting a write-up for). 
3. Create a folder with your **team name exactly how it is listed on the ctf site** under each challenge you add a write up for. This will make it easier to gather writeups from a single team in the future. 
4. Add any files that are relevant to your write up, most importantly including the write up itself. I suggest using markdown since it is pretty and is the easiest for displaying code snippets and such. Feel free to include separate files in the folder as well if they are relevant to the write-up. 
5. Submit a pull request! 

An issue is open for each challenge, feel free to discuss and link your writeups there.

Thanks again to everyone who participated, this was definitely a highlight of the MLH fellowship.
