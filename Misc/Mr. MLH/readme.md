Prompt: Swift and Will have been working really hard to create a new security system for the MLH website, and now they've come up with this access system called "Mr. MLH". In this system, each user is determined by their `User-Agent` and every user has a hash code associated with them, and only one user is our "Mr. MLH" and has admin access. </br></br> They asked you, our security specialist hero, to help out testing to see if there are any flaws on the new system. </br></br> Access the website at `35.223.35.180:4000` </br></br> **Note**: MLH User-Agents are all lowercase letters only
