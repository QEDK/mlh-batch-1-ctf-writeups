Baby we was making straight a's
But we was stuck in a dumb daze
Don't take much to memorize your lies
I fell like I've been hipnotisized

And then that magic man he come to town
Woo-wee! He done spun my head around
He said: Recess is in session
2 and 2 make 5
And now baby I am alive, oh, yeah, I am alive

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet (uh lalala)
Well baby you just better forget it (uh lalala)
Rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme (uh lalala)
You better get me to school on time (uh lalala)

Oh, you know I were on the honor roll
Got good grades and got no soul
Raised my hand before I could speak my mind
I've been bitting my tongue too many times

And then the magic man said to obey (a-ha)
Do what magic man do, not what magic man say (say what?)
Now can I please have the attention of the class
Today's assignment... Kick some ass!

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet (uh lalala)
Well baby you just better forget it (uh lalala)
Rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme (uh lalala)
You better get me to school on time (uh lalala)

This is my final exam
Now you all know who I am
I'm might not be that perfect son
But you all will be rocking when I'm done

You better get me to school on time (uh lalala)

This is my final exam
Now you all know who I am
I'm might not be that perfect son
But you all will be rocking when I'm done
Here's some jibberish text
Baby we was making straight a's
But we was stuck in a dumb daze
Don't take much to memorize your lies
I fell like I've been hipnotisized

And then that magic man he come to town
Woo-wee! He done spun my head around
He said: Recess is in session
2 and 2 make 5
And now baby I am alive, oh, yeah, I am alive

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet (uh lalala)
Well baby you just better forget it (uh lalala)
Rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme (uh lalala)
You better get me to school on time (uh lalala)

Oh, you know I were on the honor roll
Got good grades and got no soul
Raised my hand before I could speak my mind
I've been bitting my tongue too many times

And then the magic man said to obey (a-ha)
Do what magic man do, not what magic man say (say what?)
Now can I please have the attention of the class

Oh, you know I were on the honor roll
Got good grades and got no soul
Raised my hand before I could speak my mind

And then the magic man said to obey (a-ha)
Do what magic man do, not what magic man say (say what?)
Now can I please have the attention of the class
Today's assignment... Kick some ass!

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet (uh lalala)
Well baby you just better forget it (uh lalala)
Rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme (uh lalala)
You better get me to school on time (uh lalala)

This is my final exam

I'm might not be that perfect son
But you all will be rocking when I'm done

But we was stuck in a dumb daze
Don't take much to memorize your lies
I fell like I've been hipnotisized

And then that magic man he come to town
Woo-wee! He done spun my head around
He said: Recess is in session
2 and 2 make 5
And now baby I am alive, oh, yeah, I am alive

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet (uh lalala)
Well baby you just better forget it (uh lalala)
Rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme (uh lalala)
You better get me to school on time (uh lalala)

Oh, you know I were on the honor roll
Got good grades and got no soul
Raised my hand before I could speak my mind
I've been bitting my tongue too many times

And then the magic man said to obey (a-ha)
Do what magic man do, not what magic man say (say what?)
Now can I please have the attention of the class
Today's assignment... Kick some ass!

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet (uh lalala)
Well baby you just better forget it (uh lalala)
Rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme (uh lalala)
You better get me to school on time (uh lalala)

This is my final exam
Now you all know who I am
I'm might not be that perfect son
But you all will be rocking when I'm done

Here's some jibberish text

Baby we was making straight a's
But we was stuck in a dumb daze
Don't take much to memorize your lies
I fell like I've been hipnotisized

And then that magic man he come to town
Woo-wee! He done spun my head around
He said: Recess is in session
2 and 2 make 5
And now baby I am alive, oh, yeah, I am alive

Oh, you know I were on the honor roll
Got good grades and got no soul
Raised my hand before I could speak my mind
I've been bitting my tongue too many times

And then the magic man said to obey (a-ha)
Do what magic man do, not what magic man say (say what?)
Now can I please have the attention of the class

Rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme (uh lalala)
You better get me to school on time (uh lalala)

Oh, you know I were on the honor roll
Got good grades and got no soul
Raised my hand before I could speak my mind
I've been bitting my tongue too many times

And then the magic man said to obey (a-ha)
Do what magic man do, not what magic man say (say what?)
Now can I please have the attention of the class
Today's assignment... Kick some ass!

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet (uh lalala)
Well baby you just better forget it (uh lalala)
Rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme (uh lalala)
You better get me to school on time (uh lalala)

This is my final exam
Now you all know who I am
I'm might not be that perfect son
But you all will be rocking when I'm done

But we was stuck in a dumb daze
Don't take much to memorize your lies
I fell like I've been hipnotisized

And then that magic man he come to town
Woo-wee! He done spun my head around
He said: Recess is in session
2 and 2 make 5
And now baby I am alive, oh, yeah, I am alive

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet (uh lalala)
Well baby you just better forget it (uh lalala)
Rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme (uh lalala)
You better get me to school on time (uh lalala)

Oh, you know I were on the honor roll
Got good grades and got no soul
Raised my hand before I could speak my mind
I've been bitting my tongue too many times

And then the magic man said to obey (a-ha)
Do what magic man do, not what magic man say (say what?)
Now can I please have the attention of the class
Today's assignment... Kick some ass!

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet (uh lalala)
Well baby you just better forget it (uh lalala)
Rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme (uh lalala)
You better get me to school on time (uh lalala)

This is my final exam
Now you all know who I am
I'm might not be that perfect son
But you all will be rocking when I'm done

Here's some jibberish text

Here's some jibberish text
Baby we was making straight a's
But we was stuck in a dumb daze
Don't take much to memorize your lies
I fell like I've been hipnotisized

And then that magic man he come to town
Woo-wee! He done spun my head around
He said: Recess is in session
2 and 2 make 5
And now baby I am alive, oh, yeah, I am alive

Oh, you know I were on the honor roll
Got good grades and got no soul
Raised my hand before I could speak my mind
I've been bitting my tongue too many times

And then the magic man said to obey (a-ha)

Oh, you know I were on the honor roll
Got good grades and got no soul
Raised my hand before I could speak my mind
I've been bitting my tongue too many times

And then the magic man said to obey (a-ha)
Do what magic man do, not what magic man say (say what?)
Now can I please have the attention of the class
Today's assignment... Kick some ass!

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet (uh lalala)

But you all will be rocking when I'm done

Here's some jibberish text
Baby we was making straight a's
But we was stuck in a dumb daze
Don't take much to memorize your lies
I fell like I've been hipnotisized

And then that magic man he come to town
Woo-wee! He done spun my head around
He said: Recess is in session
2 and 2 make 5
And now baby I am alive, oh, yeah, I am alive

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet (uh lalala)
Well baby you just better forget it (uh lalala)
Rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme (uh lalala)
You better get me to school on time (uh lalala)

Oh, you know I were on the honor roll
Got good grades and got no soul
Raised my hand before I could speak my mind
I've been bitting my tongue too many times

And then the magic man said to obey (a-ha)
Do what magic man do, not what magic man say (say what?)
Now can I please have the attention of the class
Today's assignment... Kick some ass!

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet (uh lalala)
Well baby you just better forget it (uh lalala)
Rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme (uh lalala)
You better get me to school on time (uh lalala)

This is my final exam
Now you all know who I am
I'm might not be that perfect son
But you all will be rocking when I'm done
